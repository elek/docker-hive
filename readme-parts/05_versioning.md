## Versioning policy

  The latest tag points to the latest configuration loading and the latest stable apache version.

  If there is plain version tag without prefix it is synchronized with the version of the original apache software.

  It there is a prefix (eg. HDP) it includes a specific version from a specific distribution.

  As the configuration loading in the base image is constantly evolving even the tags of older releases may be refreshed over the time.
