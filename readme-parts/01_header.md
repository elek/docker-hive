# Hive docker images

These images are part of the bigdata docker image series. All of the images use the same [base docker image](https://github.com/elek/docker-bigdata-base) which contains advanced configuration loading. For more detailed instruction see the [README](https://github.com/elek/docker-bigdata-base/blob/master/README.md) in the docker-bigdata-base repository.
