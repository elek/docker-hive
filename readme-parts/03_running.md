Using the image depends from the configuration loading and the exact use case. You can find multiple examples in [this](https://github.com/elek/bigdata-docker) repository to use the images:

* on the local machine using docker-compose
* on remote cluster using ansible 
* on remote cluster and local macine with using docker-compose downloaded from the consul image.
